# Using-an-AVL-tree-to-handle-scheduling-airplane-landings
This code implements an efficient data structure, namely an AVL tree, to handle scheduling airplane landing times without conflicts. The project was developed as part of a Data Structure course. The data structure is self-balancing and maintains low time complexity.
